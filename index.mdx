## Quick start

:::steps

1. **Create an API key**\
   Visit the dashboard to create a secret key and a workspace for your first customer.
2. **Create a template**\
   Use the **Embeddable Template Editor** to define fields, recipients, and roles. Save once, reuse forever.

```bash
curl https://api.firma.dev/v1/envelopes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRMA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "template_id": "tpl_123",
    "recipients": [
      { "email": "alex@example.com", "role": "signer" }
    ],
