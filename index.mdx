## Introduction

Welcome to Firma — embeddable document signing for SaaS products. This guide helps product and engineering teams quickly understand how to integrate Firma into their apps.

## What is Firma?

Firma provides hosted signing flows and an embeddable template editor so you can add document signing to your product with minimal build effort. You can:

- Create siloed workspaces for each of your customers so their data stays separated.
- Embed a template editor so users can design documents inside your app.
- Embed the signing experience so signers can sign without leaving your interface.

## Embeddable links

- Template editor: https://app.firma.dev/templateEditor/{template_id}
- Signing view: https://app.firma.dev/signing/{signing_request_user_id}

## Next steps

Start with creating a workspace and then either embed the template editor or send a signing request depending on your product's needs.
