## What is Firma?

Firma provides hosted signing flows and an embeddable template editor so you can add document signing to your product with minimal build effort. You can:

- Create siloed, secure workspaces for each of your customers so their data stays separated.
- Embed a template editor so users can design documents from inside your app.
- Embed the signing experience so signers can sign without leaving your interface.
- Use workflows to enable native functionality within your app, so that you have a fully white-labeled e-signature experience.
