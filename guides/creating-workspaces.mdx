# Creating workspaces

This guide focuses on the API operations for creating and managing workspaces (previously called "teams") — the isolated tenant units used to separate customers' templates, documents, and signing requests.

Core endpoints (see the API reference for full details):

- POST `/teams` — create a workspace
- GET `/teams/{team_id}` — retrieve workspace details
- PUT `/teams/{team_id}` — update workspace
- GET `/teams` — list workspaces (pagination)

You can also find dedicated reference pages under `api-reference/teams`:

- `api-reference/teams/create-team`
- `api-reference/teams/get-team`
- `api-reference/teams/list-teams`
- `api-reference/teams/update-team`

Authentication

All requests must include an Authorization header using your API key:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Note: never expose your primary API key to end-user browsers. For per-workspace operations that need to be initiated from the frontend, call your backend which holds the key.

## Create a workspace

Endpoint: POST `/teams`

Required body: `{ "name": "string" }`

Example (curl):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.partner.com/v1/teams" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRMA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "name": "Acme Corp Workspace" }'
```

Successful response (201) returns the `Workspace` resource with `id`, `name`, and timestamps. Example shape:

```json
{
  "id": "team_123",
  "name": "Acme Corp Workspace",
  "protected": false,
  "created_date": "2025-09-04T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_date": "2025-09-04T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Server example — Node (fetch):

```js
import fetch from 'node-fetch'

export async function createWorkspace(name) {
  const resp = await fetch('https://api.partner.com/v1/teams', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.FIRMA_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ name })
  })
  if (!resp.ok) throw new Error(`create workspace failed: ${resp.status}`)
  return resp.json()
}
```

Server example — Python (requests):

```py
import os
import requests

def create_workspace(name):
    url = 'https://api.partner.com/v1/teams'
    resp = requests.post(url, headers={
        'Authorization': f"Bearer {os.environ['FIRMA_API_KEY']}",
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }, json={ 'name': name })
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return resp.json()
```

## Retrieve a workspace

Endpoint: GET `/teams/{team_id}`

Example (curl):

```bash
curl "https://api.partner.com/v1/teams/team_123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRMA_API_KEY"
```

Response: the `Workspace` resource (see example above).

## Update a workspace

Endpoint: PUT `/teams/{team_id}` — full resource replacement. Required body same as `CreateTeam` (e.g., `{ "name": "New name" }`).

Example (curl):

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.partner.com/v1/teams/team_123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRMA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "name": "Acme Corp - East Coast" }'
```

Server example — Node (fetch):

```js
export async function updateWorkspace(teamId, name) {
  const resp = await fetch(`https://api.partner.com/v1/teams/${teamId}`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.FIRMA_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ name })
  })
  if (!resp.ok) throw new Error(`update workspace failed: ${resp.status}`)
  return resp.json()
}
```

## List workspaces

Endpoint: GET `/teams`

Supports `page` and `page_size` query parameters. Example:

```bash
curl "https://api.partner.com/v1/teams?page=1&page_size=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRMA_API_KEY"
```

Response shape contains `results` (array of `Workspace`) and `pagination` metadata.

## RBAC and API key best practices

- Use scoped API keys where possible: keep a server-only master API key and create per-workspace API keys for integration partners if your platform supports it.
- Never return API keys to the browser. For operations initiated by end users, call your backend which performs the API call to Firma.
- Use idempotency where supported (for endpoints that accept `Idempotency-Key`) to avoid double-creation from retries.

## Edge cases & troubleshooting

- Duplicate names: workspace names are display-friendly and may not be unique; use the `id` for programmatic references.
- Protected workspaces: the `protected` flag indicates system-owned workspaces that cannot be deleted or modified by normal flows.
- Rate limits & errors: inspect non-2xx responses for `{ error, code }` and surface meaningful messages to operators.

## Next steps

- If you'd like, I can add example tests (unit/integration) for these server functions and a small CLI to create/list workspaces locally.
