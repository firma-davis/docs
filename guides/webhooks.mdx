Firma can notify your application about signing lifecycle events via webhooks. Common events:

- signing_request.created
- signing_request.signed
- signing_request.completed
- template.updated

## Recommended webhook flow

1. Register a webhook URL in the dashboard or via API
2. Validate incoming webhook signatures
3. Acknowledge delivery with a 2xx status code
4. Process events idempotently

## Example payload

```json
{
  "event": "signing_request.signed",
  "data": { "id": "sr_123", "template_id": "tmpl_456" }
}
```
