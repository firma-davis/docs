### Multi-Script Signature Support

Firma now supports 5 international writing systems for typed signatures with automatic script detection and curated signature fonts.

**Supported scripts:**

| Script | Languages | Signature Font |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Latin/Western | English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Czech | Default signature fonts |
| Cyrillic | Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian | Marck Script |
| Greek | Greek (including accented characters like ά, έ, ί, ό) | Zen Kurenaido |
| Japanese | Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji | Zen Kurenaido |
| Korean | Hangul | Nanum Pen Script |

Each script family includes multiple signature style options with hand-picked fonts. The system automatically detects the signer's script based on their typed name, though signers can manually switch if needed.

All signatures render correctly in completion certificates and final PDFs.

### Greek Language Support

The Firma interface is now fully available in Greek, bringing the total to 7 supported languages:

- English
- Spanish
- Portuguese
- French
